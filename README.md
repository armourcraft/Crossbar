# Crossbar

### This project is still under development!

The Crossbar is a microscale cantilever 3D printer with a build volume just big enough to print most things without taking up valuable desk space. If you like small printers, this is the next printer for you!

This printer can be run on 24V using the recommended BTT SKR Pico running Klipper, or it can be run on any old 12V board running Marlin. Either way, it will perform great. It's really up to you which direction you want to go.

## Features
- Build Size: 120mm x 120mm x 120mm
- Footprint: 280mm x 260mm x 320mm
- Net Weight: 2.7kg (6 lbs.)
- Extrusion Type: Direct Drive / Reverse Bowden
- Bed Leveling: Inductive Probe for 24V version
- Firmware: Klipper (*recommended*), will also run Marlin

### To Do List
As this is still a work in progress, there are several things still left to do:
- Cable Managment
- Reduce Part/Fastener Count (blind joints)
- Enclosure (maybe?)

## Build Tips
Print Settings are as follows:
- FDM Material: ABS recommended, but PETG will work too 
- Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Extrusion Width: Forced 0.4mm
- Infill Percentage: 40% or more recommended
- Infill Type: Gyroid or Grid (others might work as well, experiment)
- Wall Count: 4
- Solid Top/Bottom Layers: 5
- Supports: The only file that needs supports is the X Idler Mount. All other files do not need supports.

Warming! Not all 2040 rails are made the same. If you source 2040 rails that have holes too large for M5 screws, please use the STLs in the "M6_rails" folder, as they are designed for the larger M6 screw size. The length of the screw will remain the same.

### BOM
The BOM is still under development but is available on Google Sheets: [Crossbar BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKsuqmhp_ut951kFGuT7j_JkIwcnRpiDSIrPFC0hjxc/edit?usp=sharing)

### User Mods
Once the community around this printer grows, I'm sure there will be several users modding it. Those user mods will be located in the [Mods](https://github.com/armourcraft/Crossbar/tree/main/Mods) directory.
